<p>Hey! I am broadly interested in making the benefits of Artificial Intelligence (AI), accessible to the most number of people while preventing it from further harming marginalized groups. My overarching project is to use and develop AI technology and governance for positive social and environmental change. Towards this, my mission is to develop Trustworthy AI: AI that is harmless when misused, interpretable and well-understood, fair to its users, and privacy-preserving. Curious? Check out my <a href="/values">Values</a> and <a href="/research">Research</a> page.</p>

<p>Since benefits are not fully enjoyed and applied when it is not understood, I make it a crucial priority to communicate my work to people from different backgrounds through <a href="https://medium.com/@ajsanjoaquin">Medium</a> or through directly talking to people like in <a href="https://asiatechxsg.com/aisummitsingapore/speakers/ayrton-san-joaquin/">The Singapore AI Summit 2024</a>.</p>

<p>In my free time, I am a researcher at the AI Standards Lab. My current research interests are in the interactions of AI Systems and Humans, and the design of socio-political institutions to govern AI systems. I have adjacent interests in data privacy and AI for healthcare, and I have extensive experience spanning both Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.</p>

<p>I graduated from Yale-NUS College, having spent a semester at the University of Copenhagen. My bachelor’s thesis was on data privacy &amp; data poisoning, and I was advised by Reza Shokri &amp; Michael Choi. A part of that work is <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/04/12/machine_learning_poisoning">featured</a> by <em>The Register</em>.</p>

<p>You can find my CV <a href="https://ajsanjoaquin.github.io/lol/San%20Joaquin%2C%20Resume.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>As much as I specialize in Machine Learning, I identify as a <strong>generalist</strong>.</p>

<p>I did a lot of (seemingly) random activties throughout college.
I enjoy the outdoors: doing either cycling, hiking, or navigating above and below the ground. As of 09/2021, I have completed cycling around the entirety of Singapore, doing an imperial century in the process (162 km!). As of 08/2022, I have gone around the Danish archipelago via bikepacking (≈500 km)! <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_UZhPaeixAkz0IOkJ5fX9BEThES_bPoD/view">Here’s what we learned</a>. As of 04/2024, I have tried, and failed, to complete cycling around the island of Taiwan (環島) because of the 2024 Hualien Earthquake.</p>

<p>I also enjoy performing music on either the keyboard, vocals, or both. You can find concerts involving my bands Arkipelago (2019) <a href="https://youtu.be/IDWpC1mmqNs?t=2975">here</a> and Sketchy White Van (2022) <a href="https://youtu.be/qGI2ng3u13o?t=1437">here</a>.</p>

<p>I was also a yOuTubEr, when I made scripts for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/808CJK">808CJK</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, I have a love of history and staying up to date about the state of affairs. In the far past, <a href="https://globalnation.inquirer.net/142283/ph-places-5th-in-intl-history-olympiad-medal-count">I represented the Philippines</a> in the International History Olympiad.</p>

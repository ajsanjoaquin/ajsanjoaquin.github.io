Hey! I am broadly interested in making the benefits of Artificial Intelligence, specifically Machine Learning (ML), accessible to the most number of people while preventing it from further harming marginalized groups. My overarching project is to use and develop AI technology and governance for positive social and environmental change. Curious? Check out my [Values](/values/values) page. Since benefits are not fully enjoyed and applied when it is not understood, I make it a crucial priority to communicate my work to people from different backgrounds through [Medium](https://medium.com/@ajsanjoaquin).

In my free time, I am a Senior undergrad at Yale-NUS working on the intersection of Safety, Security and Ethics of ML. My current research interests are in the alignment and monitoring of large language models. I have adjacent interests in privacy and medical applications of ML, especially in computer vision. My bachelor's thesis was on increasing the privacy leakage of training data in distributed ML training with fortunate guidance from Prof. Shokri and Prof. Michael Choi of Yale-NUS. A part of that work is [featured](https://www.theregister.com/2022/04/12/machine_learning_poisoning) by *The Register*.

You can find my CV [here](https://ajsanjoaquin.github.io/lol/San%20Joaquin%2C%20Resume.pdf). 

I also do a lot of (seemingly) random activties throughout my collegiate career.
I enjoy the outdoors: doing either cycling, hiking, or walking 6 feet *above* the ground. As of 09/2021, I have completed cycling around Singapore, doing an imperial century in the process (162 km!). As of 08/2022, I have gone around the Danish archipelago via bikepacking (â‰ˆ500 km)! Our documentary film will be released soon, but [here's what we learned](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_UZhPaeixAkz0IOkJ5fX9BEThES_bPoD/view). 

I also enjoy performing music on either the keyboard, vocals, or both. You can find concerts involving my bands Arkipelago (2019) [here](https://youtu.be/IDWpC1mmqNs?t=2975) and Sketchy White Van (2022) [here](https://youtu.be/qGI2ng3u13o?t=1437).

I'm also a yOuTubEr, making scripts (and doing data science?!) for [808CJK](https://www.youtube.com/c/808CJK).

Hey! Welcome to my website. I enjoy going outdoors: doing either cycling, hiking, walking, or existing *on top of* the grass. As of 09/2021, I have completed cycling around Singapore, doing an imperial century in the process (162 km!). At the moment, I am probably just being genuinely curious about the world and doing something fun (or boring). 

In my free time, I am a Senior undergrad at Yale-NUS interested in the intersection of Safety and Ethics of Artificial Intelligence.
I am working on these issues specifically for Deep Learning models @ Data Privacy and Trustworthy Machine Learning Research Lab, NUS led by Prof. Reza Shokri.
I am also doing my bachelor's thesis with fortunate guidance from Prof. Shokri and Prof. Michael Choi of Yale-NUS.   

This website is for my non-technical articles. For my technical ones, check out my [Medium](https://medium.com/@ajsanjoaquin)! You can find my CV [here](https://ajsanjoaquin.github.io/lol/San%20Joaquin%2C%20Resume.pdf).

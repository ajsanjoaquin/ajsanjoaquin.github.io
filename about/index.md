Hey! Welcome to my website. I enjoy cycling, and I have mostly exhausted Singapore's cycling routes. As of 07/2021, I just got into Geocaching, and I will probably be off exploring whenever I get the chance. At the moment, I am probably just being genuinely curious about the world and doing something fun (or boring). 

In my free time, I am a Senior undergrad at Yale-NUS interested in the intersection of Safety and Ethics of Artificial Intelligence.
I am currently working on these issues specifically for Deep Learning models @ Data Privacy and Trustworthy Machine Learning Research Lab, NUS led by Prof. Reza Shokri.  

This website is for my non-technical articles. For my technical ones, check out my [Medium](https://medium.com/@ajsanjoaquin)! You can find my CV [here](https://ajsanjoaquin.github.io/lol/San%20Joaquin%2C%20Resume.pdf).
